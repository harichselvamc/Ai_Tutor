Thermodynamics, the study of the transformation of energy, explains all such processes quantitatively and allows us to make useful predictions.\n\nIn the $19^{\\text {th }}$ century, scientists tried to understand the underlying principles of steam engine which were already in operation, in order to improve their efficiency. The basic problem of the investigation was the transformation of heat into mechanical work. However, over time, the laws of thermodynamics were developed and helped to understand the process of steam engine. These laws have been used to deduce powerful mathematical relationships applicable to a broad range of processes.\n\nThermodynamics evaluates the macroscopic properties (heat, work) and their inter relationships. It deals with properties of systems in equilibrium and is independent of any theories or properties of the individual molecules which constitute the system.\n\nThe principles of thermodynamics are based on three laws of thermodynamics. The first two laws (First and second law) summarise the actual experience of inter\nconversion of different forms of energy. The third law deals with the calculation of entropy and the unattainability of absolute zero Kelvin. Thermodynamics carries high practical values but bears certain limitations. It is independent of atomic and molecular structure and reaction mechanism. The laws can be used to predict whether a particular reaction is feasible or not under a given set of conditions, but they cannot give the rate at which the reaction takes place. In other words, thermodynamics deals with equilibrium conditions quantitatively, but does not take into account the kinetic approach to the equilibrium state.\n\n### 7.2 System and Surrounding\n\nBefore studying the laws of thermodynamics and their applications, it is important to understand the meaning of a few terms used frequently in thermodynamics.\n\n## System:\n\nThe universe is divided into two parts, the system and its surroundings. The system is the part of universe which is under thermodynamic consideration. It is separated from the rest of the universe by real or imaginary boundaries.\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7.1 System, surrounding \\& boundary Homogeneous and heterogeneous systems\n\n## Example:\n\nThe system may be water in a beaker, a balloon filled with air, an aqueous solution of glucose etc.\n\nOn the basis of physical and chemical properties, systems can be divided into two types.\n\nA system is called homogeneous if the physical state of all its constituents are the same. Example: a mixture of gases, completely miscible mixture of liquids etc.\n\nA system is called heterogeneous, if physical state of all its constituents is not the same.\n\nExample: mixture of oil and water\n\n## Surrounding:\n\nEverything in the universe that is not the part of the system is called surroundings.\n\n## Boundary:\n\nAnything which separates the system from its surrounding is called boundary.\n\n### 7.2.1 Types of systems:\n\nThere are three types of thermodynamic systems depending on the nature of the boundary.\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7.2 Types of Systems\n\n## Isolated system:\n\nA system which can exchange neither matter nor energy with its surroundings is called an isolated system. Here boundary is sealed and insulated. Hot water contained in a thermos flask, is an example for an isolated system. In this isolated system both energy (heat) and matter (water vapour) neither enter nor leave the system.\n\n## Closed system:\n\nA system which can exchange only energy but not matter with its surroundings is called a closed system. Here the boundary is sealed but not insulated. Hot water contained in a closed beaker is an example for a closed system. In this system energy (heat) is transferred to the surroundings but no matter (water vapour) can escape from this system. A gas contained in a cylinder fitted with a piston constitutes a closed system.\n\n## Open system:\n\nA System which can exchange both matter and energy with its surrounding is called an open system. Hot water contained in an open beaker is an example for open system. In this system both matter (water vapour) and energy (heat) is transferred to the surrounding.\n\nAll living things and chemical reactions are open systems because they exchange matter and energy with the surroundings.\n\n### 7.2.2 Properties of the system:\n\n## Intensive and extensive properties\n\nSome of the properties of a system depend on its mass or size whereas other properties do not depend on its mass or size. Based on this, the properties of a system are grouped as extensive property and intensive property.\n\n## Extensive properties:\n\nThe property that depends on the mass or the size of the system is called an extensive property.\n\nExamples: Volume, Number of moles, Mass, Internal energy, etc.,\n\n## Intensive properties:\n\nThe property that is independent of the mass or the size of the system is called an intensive property.\n\nExamples : Refractive index, Surface tension, density, temperature, Boiling point, Freezing point, molar volume, etc.,\n\nTable: 7.1 Typical List of Extensive and Intensive properties\n\n| Extensive <br> properties | Intensive <br> properties |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| volume, mass, <br> amount of <br> substance (mole), <br> energy, enthalpy, <br> entropy, free <br> energy, heat <br> capacity | molar volume, <br> density, molar <br> mass, molarity, <br> mole fraction, <br> molality, <br> specific heat <br> capacity |\n\n### 7.2.3 Thermodynamic processes\n\nThe method of operation which can bring about a change in the system is called thermodynamic process. Heating, cooling, expansion, compression, fusion, vaporization etc., are some examples of a thermodynamic process.\n\n## Types of processes:\n\nA thermodynamic process can be carried out in different ways and under different conditions. The processes can be classified as follows:\n\n## Reversible process:\n\nThe process in which the system and surrounding can be restored to the initial state from the final state without producing any changes in the thermodynamic properties of the universe is called a reversible process. There are two important conditions for the reversible process to occur. Firstly, the process should occur infinitesimally slowly and secondly throughout the process, the system and surroundings must be in equilibrium with each other.\n\n## Irreversible Process:\n\nThe process in which the system and surrounding cannot be restored to the initial state from the final state is called an irreversible process. All the processes occurring in nature are irreversible processes. During the irreversible process the system and surroundings are not in equilibrium with each other.\n\n## Adiabatic process:\n\nAn adiabatic process is defined as one in which there is no exchange of heat (q) between the system and surrounding during the process. Those processes in which no heat can flow into or out of the system are called adiabatic processes. This condition is attained by thermally insulating the system. In an adiabatic process if work is done by the system its temperature decreases, if work is done on the system its temperature increases, because, the system cannot exchange heat with its surroundings.\n\nFor an adiabatic process $\\mathrm{q}=0$\n\n## Isothermal process :\n\nAn isothermal process is defined as one in which the temperature of the system remains constant, during the change from its initial to final state. The system exchanges heat with its surrounding and the temperature of the system remains constant. For this purpose the experiment is often performed in a thermostat.\n\nFor an isothermal process $d T=0$\n\n## Isobaric process\n\nAn isobaric process is defined as one in which the pressure of the system remains constant during its change from the initial to final state.\n\nFor an isobaric process $d P=0$.\n\n## Isochoric process\n\nAn isochoric process is defined as\nthe one in which the volume of system remains constant during its change from initial to final state. Combustion of a fuel in a bomb calorimeter is an example of an isochoric process.\n\nFor an isochoric process, $\\mathrm{d} V=0$.\n\n## Cyclic process:\n\nWhen a system returns to its original state after completing a series of changes, then it is said that a cycle is completed. This process is known as a cyclic process.\n\nFor a cyclic process $\\mathrm{dU}=0, \\mathrm{dH}=0$, $\\mathrm{dP}=0, \\mathrm{dV}=0, \\mathrm{dT}=0$\n\nTable: 7.2 Overview of the process and its condition\n\n| Process | Condition |\n| :-- | :-- |\n| Adiabatic | $\\mathrm{q}=0$ |\n| Isothermal | $\\mathrm{dT}=0$ |\n| Isobaric | $\\mathrm{dP}=0$ |\n| Isochoric | $\\mathrm{dV}=0$ |\n| Cyclic | $\\mathrm{dE}=0, \\mathrm{dH}=0, \\mathrm{dP}=0$, <br> $\\mathrm{dV}=0, \\mathrm{dT}=0$ |\n\nState functions, path functions:\n\n## State function\n\nA thermodynamic system can be defined by using the variables $\\mathrm{P}, \\mathrm{V}, \\mathrm{T}$ and ' n '. A state function is a thermodynamic property of a system, which has a specific value for a given state and does not depend on the path (or manner) by which the particular state is reached.\n\nExample : Pressure (P), Volume (V), Temperature(T), Internal energy (U), Enthalpy $(\\mathrm{H})$, free energy (G) etc.\n\n## Path functions:\n\nA path function is a thermodynamic property of the system whose value depends on the path by which the system changes from its initial to final states.\n\n## Example: Work (w), Heat (q).\n\nWork (w) will have different values if the process is carried out reversibly or irreversibly.\n\n## Internal Energy (U)\n\nThe internal energy is a characteristic property of a system which is denoted by the symbol $U$. The internal energy of a system is equal to the energy possessed by all its constituents namely atoms, ions and molecules. The total energy of all molecules in a system is equal to the sum of their translational energy $\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{t}}\\right)$, vibrational energy $\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{v}}\\right)$, rotational energy $\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{r}}\\right)$, bond energy $\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{b}}\\right)$, electronic energy $\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{e}}\\right)$ and energy due to molecular interactions $\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\right)$.\n\nThus:\n$\\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{t}}+\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{v}}+\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{r}}+\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{b}}+\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{e}}+\\mathrm{U}_{\\mathrm{i}}$\nThe total energy of all the molecules of the system is called internal energy. In thermodynamics one is concerned only with the change in internal energy $(\\Delta \\mathrm{U})$ rather than the absolute value of energy.\n\n## Importance of Internal energy\n\nThe internal energy possessed by a substance differentiates its physical structure. For example, the allotropes of carbon, namely, graphite C (graphite) and diamond C (diamond), differ from each other because they possess different internal energies and have different structures.\n\n## Characteristics of internal energy (U):\n\n- The internal energy of a system is an extensive property. It depends on the amount of the substances present in the system. If the amount is doubled, the internal energy is also doubled.\n- The internal energy of a system is a state function. It depends only upon the state variables (T, P, V, n) of the system. The change in internal energy does not depend on the path by which the final state is reached.\n- The change in internal energy of a system is expressed as $\\Delta \\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{U}_{f}-\\mathrm{U}_{i}$\n- In a cyclic process, there is no internal energy change. $\\Delta \\mathrm{U}_{\\text {(cyclic) }}=0$\n- If the internal energy of the system in the final state $\\left(U_{f}\\right)$ is less than the internal energy of the system in its initial state $\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{i}\\right)$, then $\\Delta \\mathrm{U}$ would be negative.\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{U}_{f}-\\mathrm{U}_{i}=-\\mathrm{ve} \\quad\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{f}<\\mathrm{U}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\n- If the internal energy of the system in the final state $\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{f}\\right)$ is greater than the internal energy of the system in its initial state $\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{i}\\right)$, then $\\Delta \\mathrm{U}$ would be positive.\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{U}_{f}-\\mathrm{U}_{i}=+\\mathrm{ve} \\quad\\left(\\mathrm{U}_{f}>\\mathrm{U}_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\n## HEAT(q)\n\nThe heat (q) is regarded as an energy in transit across the boundary separating a system from its surrounding. Heat changes lead to temperature differences between system and surrounding. Heat is a path function.\n\n## Units of heat:\n\nThe SI unit of heat is joule (J). Heat quantities are generally measured in calories (cal). A calorie is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by $1^{0} \\mathrm{C}$ in the vicinity of $15^{0} \\mathrm{C}$.\n\n## Sign convention of heat:\n\nThe symbol of heat is $q$.\nIf heat flows into the system from the surrounding, energy of a system increases. Hence it is taken to be positive $(+\\mathrm{q})$.\n\nIf heat flows out of the system into the surrounding, energy of the system decreases. Hence, it is taken to be negative $(-q)$.\n\n## Work(w)\n\nWork is defined as the force ( F ) multiplied by the displacement $(x)$.\n$-\\mathrm{w}=\\mathrm{F} . x \\quad--------(7.1)$\nThe negative sign $(-)$ is introduced to indicate that the work has been done by the system by spending a part of its internal energy.\n\nThe work,\n(i) is a path function.\n(ii) appears only at the boundary of the system.\n(iii) appears during the change in the state of the system.\n(iv) In thermodynamics, surroundings is so large that macroscopic changes to surroundings do not happen.\n\n## Units of work:\n\nThe SI unit of work is joule (J), which is defined as the work done by a force of one Newton through a displacement of one meter ( $\\mathrm{J}=\\mathrm{Nm}$ ). We often use kilojoule ( $k \\mathrm{~J}$ ) for large quantities of work. $1 \\mathrm{~kJ}=1000 \\mathrm{~J}$.\n\nSign convention of work:\nThe symbol of work is ' $w$ '.\nIf work is done by the system, the energy of the system decreases, hence by convention, work is taken to be negative $(-\\mathrm{w})$.\n\nIf work is done on the system, the energy of the system increases, hence by convention, the work is taken to be positive $(+\\mathrm{w})$.\n\n## Pressure - volume work\n\nIn elementary thermodynamics the only type of work generally considered is the work done in expansion (or compression) of a gas. This is known as pressure-volume work, PV work or expansion work.\n\nWork involved in expansion and compression processes:\n\nIn most thermodynamic calculations we are dealing with the evaluation of work involved in the expansion or compression of gases. The essential condition for expansion or compression of a system is that there should be difference between external pressure $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }}\\right)$ and internal pressure $\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {int }}\\right)$.\n\nFor understanding pressurevolume work, let us consider a cylinder which contains ' $n$ ' moles of an ideal gas fitted with a frictionless piston of cross sectional area A. The total volume of the gas inside is $\\mathrm{V}_{i}$ and pressure of the gas inside is $\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {int }}$.\n\nIf the external pressure $\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }}$ is greater than $\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {int }}$, the piston moves inward till the pressure inside becomes equal to $\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }}$. Let this change be achieved in a single step and the final volume be $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{f}}$.\n\nIn this case, the work is done on the system $(+\\mathrm{w})$. It can be calculated as follows\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{w}=-\\mathrm{F} . \\Delta \\mathrm{x}\n$$\n\nwhere dx is the distance moved by the piston during the compression and F is the force acting on the gas.\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7.3 showing work involved in compression processes\n\n$$\nF=\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }} A \\cdots-(7.3)\n$$\n\nSubstituting 7.3 in 7.2\n$\\mathrm{w} \\quad=\\quad-\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }} \\cdot A \\cdot \\Delta x$\n$A . \\Delta x=$ change in volume $=V_{\\mathrm{f}}-V_{1}$\n$\\mathrm{w} \\quad=\\quad-\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }} \\cdot\\left(V_{\\mathrm{f}}-V_{1}\\right)$------ (7.4)\n$\\mathrm{w} \\quad=\\quad-\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }} \\cdot(-\\Delta V)$------ (7.5)\n$=\\quad \\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }} \\cdot \\Delta V$\nSince work is done on the system, it is a positive quantity.\n\nIf the pressure is not constant, but changes during the process such that it is always infinitesimally greater than the pressure of the gas, then, at each stage of compression, the volume decreases by an infinitesimal amount, dV . In such a case we can calculate the work done on the gas by the relation\n\n$w_{\\text {rev }}=-\\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}} P_{\\text {ext }} d V$\n\nIn a compression process, $\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }}$ the external pressure is always greater than the pressure of the system.\ni.e $\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }}=\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {int }}+\\mathrm{dP}\\right)$.\n\nIn an expansion process, the external pressure is always less than the pressure of the system\ni.e. $\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }}=\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {int }}-\\mathrm{dP}\\right)$.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7.4\nWhen pressure is not constant and changes in infinitesimally small steps (reversible conditions) during compression from $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ to $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{f}}$, the $\\mathrm{P}-\\mathrm{V}$ plot looks like in fig 7.4 Work done on the gas is represented by the shaded area.\n\nIn general case we can write,\n$\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {ext }}=\\left(\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {int }} \\pm \\mathrm{dP}\\right)$. Such processes are called reversible processes. For a compression process work can be related to internal pressure of the system under reversible conditions by writing equation\n\n$$\nw_{\\text {rev }}=-\\int_{V_{i}}^{V_{f}} P_{\\text {int }} d V\n$$\n\nFor a given system with an ideal gas\n$\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {int }} \\mathrm{V}=\\mathrm{nRT}$\n$\\mathrm{P}_{\\text {int }}=\\frac{\\mathrm{nRT}}{\\mathrm{V}}$\n$\\mathrm{w}_{\\text {rev }}=-\\int_{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{f}}} \\frac{\\mathrm{nRT}}{\\mathrm{V}} \\mathrm{dV}$\n$\\mathrm{w}_{\\text {rev }}=-\\mathrm{nRT} \\int_{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}}^{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{f}}}\\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{dV}}{\\mathrm{V}}\\right)$\n$\\mathrm{w}_{\\text {rev }}=-\\mathrm{nRT} \\ln \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\right)$\n$\\mathrm{w}_{\\text {rev }}=-2.303 \\mathrm{nRT} \\log \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}}{\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\right)-----7.6$\n\nIf $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{f}}>\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ (expansion), the sign of work done by the process is negative.\n\nIf $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{f}}<\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{i}}$ (compression) the sign of work done on the process is positive.\n\nTable: 7.3 Summary of sign conventions\n\n| 1. | If heat is absorbed by the <br> system | $+q$ |\n| :-- | :-- | :-- |\n| 2. | If heat is evolved by the <br> system | $-q$ |\n| 3. | work is done by the system | $-w$ |\n| 4. | worki s dne on the system | $+w$ |\n\n### 7.3 Zeroth law of thermodynamics:\n\nThe zeroth law of thermodynamics, also known as the law of thermal equilibrium, was put forward much after the establishment of the first and second laws of thermodynamics. It is placed\n\nbefore the first and second laws as it provides a logical basis for the concept of temperature of the system.\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nFigure : 7.5 Zeroth law of thermodynamics:\nThe law states that `If two systems are separately in thermal equilibrium with a third one, then they tend to be in thermal equilibrium with themselves'.\n\nAccording to this law, if systems B and C separately are in thermal equilibrium with another system A , then systems B and C will also be in thermal equilibrium with each other. This is also the principle by which thermometers are used.\n\n### 7.4 First Law of Thermodynamics:\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics, known as the law of conservation of energy, states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant though it may change from one form to another.\n\nWhen a system moves from state 1 to state 2 , its internal energy changes from $\\mathrm{U}_{1}$ to $\\mathrm{U}_{2}$. Then change in internal energy\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{U}_{2}-\\mathrm{U}_{1}\n$$\n\nThis internal energy change is brought about by the either absorption or evolution of heat and/or by work being done by/on the system.\n\nBecause the total energy of the system must remain constant, we can write the mathematical statement of the First Law as:\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{q}+\\mathrm{w}$ $\\qquad$\nWhere q - the amount of heat supplied to the system; w - work done on the system\n\nOther statements of first law of thermodynamics\n(1) Whenever an energy of a particular type disappears, an equivalent amount of another type must be produced.\n(2) The total energy of a system and surrounding remains constant (or conserved)\n(3) \"Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but may be converted from one form to another\".\n(4) \"The change in the internal energy of a closed system is equal to the energy that passes through its boundary as heat or work\".\n(5) \"Heat and work are two ways of changing a system's internal energy\".\n\n### 7.4.1 Mathematical statement of the first law\n\nThe mathematical statement of the first law of thermodynamics is\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{q}+\\mathrm{w} \\quad-------7.7\n$$\n\nCase 1 : For a cyclic process involving isothermal expansion of an ideal gas,\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U}=0\n$$\n\neqn $(7.7) \\Rightarrow \\therefore \\mathrm{q}=-\\mathrm{w}$\nIn other words, during a cyclic process, the amount of heat absorbed by the system is equal to work done by the system.\n\nCase 2 : For an isochoric process (no change in volume) there is no work of expansion. i.e. $\\Delta \\mathrm{V}=0$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U} & =\\mathrm{q}+\\mathrm{w} \\\\\n& =\\mathrm{q}-\\mathrm{P} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n\\Delta \\mathrm{~V} & =0 \\\\\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U} & =\\mathrm{q}_{\\mathrm{v}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn other words, during an isochoric process, the amount of heat supplied to the system is converted to its internal energy.\n\nCase 3 : For an adiabatic process there is no change in heat. i.e. $\\mathrm{q}=0$. Hence\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{q}=0\n$$\n\neqn $(7.7) \\Rightarrow \\Delta \\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{w}$\nIn other words, in an adiabatic process, the decrease in internal energy\nis exactly equal to the work done by the system on its surroundings.\n\nCase 4 : For an isobaric process. There is no change in the pressure. P remains constant. Hence\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{lll}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U} & =\\mathrm{q}+\\mathrm{w} \\\\\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U} & =\\mathrm{q}-\\mathrm{P} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIn other words, in an isobaric process a part of heat absorbed by the system is used for PV expansion work and the remaining is added to the internal energy of the system.\n\n## Problem: 7.1\n\nA gas contained in a cylinder fitted with a frictionless piston expands against a constant external pressure of 1 atm from a volume of 5 litres to a volume of 10 litres. In doing so it absorbs 400 J of thermal energy from its surroundings.

That is,\n$\\mathrm{H}=\\mathrm{U}+\\mathrm{PV} \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots \\ldots$\n\nIt reflects the capacity to do mechanical work and the capacity to release heat by the system. When a process occurs at constant pressure, the heat involved (either released or absorbed) is equal to the change in enthalpy.\n\nEnthalpy is a state function which depends entirely on the state functions T, P and U.

The equation 7.18 becomes\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{c}=\\mathrm{q}\n$$\n\nThus specific heat capacity of a\n\nsystem is defined as \"The heat absorbed by one kilogram of a substance to raise its temperature by one Kelvin at a specified temperature\".\n\nThe heat capacity for 1 mole of substance, is called molar heat capacity $\\left(\\mathrm{c}_{m}\\right)$.

Since $\\Delta \\mathrm{U}$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm{H}$ are functions of the state of the system, the heat evolved or absorbed in a given reaction depends only on the initial state and final state of the system and not on the path or the steps by which the change takes place.\n\nThis generalisation is known as Hess's law and stated as:\n\nThe enthalpy change of a reaction either at constant volume or constant pressure is the same whether it takes place in a single or multiple steps provided the initial and final states are same.\n![img-13.jpeg](img-13.jpeg)\n\nApplication of Hess's Law: Hess's law can be applied to calculate enthalpies of reactions that are difficult to measure. For example, it is very difficult to measure the heat of combustion of graphite to give pure CO.\n\nHowever, enthalpy for the oxidation of graphite to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and CO to $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can easily be measured. For these conversions, the heat of combustion values are -393.5 kJ and -283.5 kJ respectively.\n\nFrom these data the enthalpy of combustion of graphite to CO can be calculated by applying Hess's law.\n\nThe reactions involved in this process can be expressed as follows\n![img-14.jpeg](img-14.jpeg)\n\nAccording to Hess law,\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{1}=\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{2}+\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{3} \\\\\n-393.5 \\mathrm{~kJ}=\\mathrm{X}-283.5 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\\\\n\\mathrm{X}=-110.5 \\mathrm{~kJ}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n7.9 Lattice energy $\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\text {lattice }}\\right)$\n\nLattice energy is defined as the amount of energy required to completely remove the constituent ions from its crystal lattice to an infinite distance. It is also referred as lattice enthalpy.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{NaCl}(\\mathrm{~s}) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{Na}^{+}(\\mathrm{g})+\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}(\\mathrm{g}) \\\\\n& \\qquad \\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\text {lattice }}=+788 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom the above equation it is clear that 788 kJ of energy is required to separate $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions from 1 mole of NaCl .\n\n## Born - Haber cycle\n\nThe Born-Haber cycle is an approach to analyse reaction energies. It was named after two German scientists Max Born and Fritz Haber who developed this cycle. The cycle is concerned with the formation of an ionic compound from the reaction of a metal with a halogen or other non-metallic element such as oxygen.\n\nBorn-Haber cycle is primarily used in calculating lattice energy, which cannot be measured directly. The Born-Haber cycle applies Hess's law to calculate the lattice enthalpy. For example consider the formation of a simple ionic solid such as an alkali metal halide MX , the following steps are considered.\n![img-15.jpeg](img-15.jpeg)\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{1}$ - enthalpy change for the sublimation $\\mathrm{M}(\\mathrm{s})$ to $\\mathrm{M}(\\mathrm{g})$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{2}$ - enthalpy change $\\frac{1}{2} \\mathrm{X}_{2}(\\mathrm{~g})$ to $\\mathrm{X}(\\mathrm{g})$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{3}$ - Ionisation energy for $\\mathrm{M}(\\mathrm{g})$ to $\\mathrm{M}^{+}(\\mathrm{g})$ $\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{4}$ - electron affinity for the conversion of $\\mathrm{X}(\\mathrm{g})$ to $\\mathrm{X}^{-}(\\mathrm{g})$\nU - the lattice enthalpy for the formation of solid MX\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{f}}$ - enthalpy change for the formation of solid MX directly form elements\nAccording to Hess's law of heat summation\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{f}}=\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{1}+\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{2}+\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{3}+\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{4}+\\mathrm{U}\n$$\n\nLet us use the Born - Haber cycle for determining the lattice enthalpy of NaCl as follows:\n\nSince the reaction is carried out with reactants in elemental forms and products in their standard states, at 1 bar, the overall enthalpy change of the reaction is also the enthalpy of formation for NaCl . Also, the formation of NaCl can be considered in 5 steps. The sum of the enthalpy changes of these steps is equal to the enthalpy change for the overall reaction from which the lattice enthalpy of NaCl is calculated.\n\nLet us calculate the lattice energy of sodium chloride using Born-Haber cycle\n![img-16.jpeg](img-16.jpeg)\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{f}}=$ heat of formation of sodium chloride $=-411.3 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{1}=$ heat of sublimation of $\\mathrm{Na}(\\mathrm{S})=$ $108.7 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{2}=$ ionisation energy of $\\mathrm{Na}(\\mathrm{S})=$ $495.0 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{3}=$ dissociation energy of $\\mathrm{Cl}_{2}(\\mathrm{~S})$ $=244 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{4}=$ Electron affinity of $\\mathrm{Cl}(\\mathrm{S})=$ $-349.0 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{U}=(\\text {-411.3 })-(\\text { 376.7 })\n$$\n\n$\\therefore \\mathrm{U}=-788 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$\nThis negative sign in lattice energy indicates that the energy is released when sodium is formed from its constituent gaseous ions $\\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$\n\n## Evaluate Yourself - 4\n\nWhen a mole of magnesium bromide is prepared from 1 mole of magnesium and 1 mole of liquid bromine, 524 kJ of energy is released.\n\nThe heat of sublimation of Mg metal is $148 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$.

Calculate the lattice energy of magnesium bromide.\n7.10. Second Law of thermodynamics:\n\nNeed for the second law of thermodynamics:\nWe know from the first law of thermodynamics, the energy of the universe is conserved. Let us consider the following processes:\n\n1. A glass of hot water over time loses heat energy to the surrounding and becomes cold.\n2. When you mix hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide, it forms sodium chloride and water with evolution of heat.\n\nIn both these processes, the total energy is conserved and are consistent with the first law of thermodynamics. However, the reverse process i.e. cold water becoming hot water by absorbing heat from surrounding on its own does not occur spontaneously even though the energy change involved in this process is also consistent with the first law. However, if the heat energy is supplied to cold water, then it will become hot. i.e. the change that does not occur spontaneously and an be driven by supplying energy.\n\nSimilarly, a solution of sodium chloride does not absorb heat energy on its own, to form hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. But, this process can not be driven even by supplying energy. From these kinds of our natural experiences, we have come to know that certain processes are spontaneous while the others are not, and some processes have a preferred direction. In order to explain the feasibility of a process, we need the second law of thermodynamics.\n\n### 7.10.1 Various statements of the second law of thermodynamics\n\n## Entropy\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics introduces another state function called entropy. Entropy is a measure of the\nmolecular disorder (randomness) of a system. But thermodynamic definition of entropy is concerned with the change in entropy that occurs as a result of a process.\n\nIt is defined as, $\\mathrm{dS}=\\mathrm{dq}_{\\text {rev }} / \\mathrm{T}$\n\n## Entropy statement:\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics can be expressed in terms of entropy. i.e \"the entropy of an isolated system increases during a spontaneous process\".\n\nFor an irreversible process such as spontaneous expansion of a gas,\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {total }}>0$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {total }}>\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {system }}+\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {surrounding }}$\ni.e. $\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {universe }}>\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {system }}+\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {surrounding }}$\n\nFor a reversible process such as melting of ice,\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {system }}=-\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {surrounding }}$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {universe }}=0$\n\n## Kelvin-Planck statement:\n\nIt is impossible to construct a machine that absorbs heat from a hot source and converts it completely into work by a cyclic process without transferring a part of heat to a cold sink. The second law of thermodynamics explains why even an ideal, frictionless engine cannot convert $100 \\%$ of its input heat into work. Carnot on his analysis of heat engines, found that the maximum efficiency of a heat engine which operates reversibly, depends only on the two temperatures between which it is operated.\n\nEfficiency $=$ work performed $/$ heat absorbed\n\n$$\n\\eta=\\frac{\\left|q_{h}\\right|-\\left|q_{c}\\right|}{\\left|q_{h}\\right|}\n$$\n\n$\\mathrm{q}_{\\mathrm{h}}$ - heat absorbed from the hot reservoir\n$\\mathrm{q}_{\\mathrm{c}}$ - heat transferred to cold reservoir\n\n$$\n\\eta=1-\\frac{\\left|q_{c}\\right|}{\\left|q_{h}\\right|},---(7.27)\n$$\n\nFor a reversible cyclic process\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {universe }}=\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {system }}+\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {surroundings }}=0$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {system }}=-\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {surroundings }} \\\\\n& \\frac{\\mathrm{q}_{\\mathrm{h}}}{\\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{h}}}=\\frac{-\\mathrm{q}_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{c}}} \\\\\n& \\frac{-\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{h}}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{q}_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\mathrm{q}_{\\mathrm{h}}} \\\\\n& \\frac{\\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{h}}}=\\frac{\\left|\\mathrm{q}_{\\mathrm{c}}\\right|}{\\left|\\mathrm{q}_{\\mathrm{h}}\\right|},---7.28\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nSustituting 7.28 in 7.27\n\n$$\n\\Rightarrow \\eta=1-\\frac{\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{h}}},----7.29\n$$\n\n$\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{h}} \\gg \\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{c}}$\nHence, $\\eta<1$\nefficiency in percentage can be expressed as\n\nEfficiency in percentage $=\\left[1-\\frac{\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{h}}}\\right] \\times 100$\nClausius statement:\nIt is impossible to transfer heat from a cold reservoir to a hot reservoir without doing some work.\n\nProblem: 7.10\nIf an automobile engine burns petrol at a temperature of $816^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and if the surrounding temperature is $21^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$, calculate its maximum possible efficiency.\n\n## Solution:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\% \\text { Efficiency }=\\left[\\frac{\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{h}}-\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{c}}}{\\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{h}}}\\right] \\times 100 \\\\\n& \\text { Here }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{h}}=816+273=1089 \\mathrm{~K} \\\\\n& \\mathrm{~T}_{\\mathrm{c}}=21+273=294 \\mathrm{~K} \\\\\n& \\% \\text { Efficiency }=\\left(\\frac{1089-294}{1089}\\right) \\times 100\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\\% Efficiency $=73 \\%$\n\n## Evaluate Yourself - 5\n\nAn engine operating between $127^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and $47^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ takes some specified amount of heat from a high temperature reservoir. Assuming that there are no frictional losses, calculate the percentage efficiency of an engine.\n\n## Unit of entropy:\n\nThe entropy ( S ) is equal to heat energy exchanged (q) divided by the temperature ( T ) at which the exchange takes place. Therefore, The SI unit of entropy is $\\mathrm{JK}^{-1}$.\n\n## Spontaneity and Randomness\n\nCareful examination shows that in each of the processes viz., melting of ice and evaporation of water, there is an increase in randomness or disorder of the system. The water molecules in ice\n\nare arranged in a highly organised crystal pattern which permits little movement. As the ice melts, the water molecules become disorganised and can move more freely. The movement of molecules becomes freer in the liquid phase and even more free in the vapour phase. In other words, we can say that the randomness of the water molecules increases, as ice melts into water or water evaporates. Both are spontaneous processes which result in a increase in randomness (entropy).\n![img-17.jpeg](img-17.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7.8 Illustration showing an increase in disorder.\n\n## Standard Entropy Change $\\left(\\Delta S^{0}\\right)$ :\n\nIt is possible to calculate the actual entropy of a substance at any temperature above 0 K . The absolute entropy of a substance at 298 K and one bar pressure is called the standard entropy $\\mathrm{S}^{0}$. The third law of thermodynamics states, according to Nernst, that the absolute entropy of elements is zero only at 0 K in a perfect crystal, and standard entropies of all substances at any temperature above 0 K always have positive values. Once we know the entropies of different substances, we\ncan calculate the standard entropy change $\\left(\\Delta S_{r}^{0}\\right)$ for chemical reactions.\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{r}}^{0}=\\sum \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {products }}^{0}-\\sum \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {reactants }}^{0}$\nStandard Entropy of Formation:\nStandard entropy of formation is defined as \"the entropy of formation of 1 mole of a compound from the elements under standard conditions\".

A reaction that occurs under the given set of conditions without any external driving force is called a spontaneous reaction. Otherwise, it is said to be non-spontaneous. In our day today life, we observe many spontaneous physical and chemical\n\nprocesses, which includes the following examples.\n\n1. A waterfall runs downhill, but never uphill, spontaneously.\n2. A lump of sugar dissolves spontaneously in a cup of coffee, but never reappears in its original form spontaneously.\n3. Heat flows from hotter object to a colder one, but never flows from colder to hotter object spontaneously.\n4. The expansion of a gas into an evacuated bulb is a spontaneous process, the reverse process that is gathering of all molecules into one bulb is not. spontaneous.\n![img-18.jpeg](img-18.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7.9 Spontaneous process illustration\n\nThese examples show that the processes that occur spontaneously in one direction, cannot take place in opposite direction spontaneously.\n\nSimilarly a large number of exothermic reactions are spontaneous. An example is combustion of methane.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{CH}_{4}+2 \\mathrm{O}_{2} & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{CO}_{2}+2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O} \\\\\n& \\Delta \\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{o}}=-890.4 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAnother example is acid-base neutralization reaction:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{H}^{+}+\\mathrm{OH}^{-} & \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O} \\\\\n& \\Delta \\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{o}}=-57.32 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHowever, some endothermic processes are also spontaneous. For example ammonium nitrate dissolves in water spontaneously though this dissolution is endothermic.\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathrm{NH}_{4} \\mathrm{NO}_{3} \\xrightarrow{\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}} \\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}+\\mathrm{NO}_{3}^{-} \\\\\n& \\Delta \\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{o}}=+25 \\mathrm{~kJ} \\mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFrom the above examples we can come to the conclusion that exothermicity favors the spontaneity but does not guarantee it. We cannot decide whether or not a chemical reaction will occur spontaneously solely on the basis of energy changes in the system. We know from second law of thermodynamics that in a spontaneous process, the entropy increases. But not all the processes which are accompanied by an increase in entropy are spontaneous. In order to predict the spontaneity of a reaction, we need some other thermodynamic function.\n\nThe second law of thermodynamics introduces another thermodynamic function called Gibbs free energy which finds useful in predicting the spontaneity of a reaction. The Gibbs free energy (G) was developed in the 1870's by Josiah Willard Gibbs. He originally termed this energy as the \"available energy\" to do work in a system. This quantity is the energy associated with a chemical reaction that can be used to do work.\n\nGibbs free energy is defined as below\n$\\mathrm{G}=\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{TS}-----------(7.35)$\nGibbs free energy (G) is an extensive property and it is a single valued\n\nstate function.\nLet us consider a system which undergoes a change of state from state (1) to state (2) at constant temperature.\n$\\mathrm{G}_{2}-\\mathrm{G}_{1}=\\left(\\mathrm{H}_{2}-\\mathrm{H}_{1}\\right)-\\mathrm{T}\\left(\\mathrm{S}_{2}-\\mathrm{S}_{1}\\right)$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{G}=\\Delta \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}-----(7.36)$\nNow let us consider how $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ is related to reaction spontaneity.\n\nWe know that\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {total }}=\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {sys }}+\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {surr }}$\nFor a reversible process (equilibrium), the change in entropy of universe is zero. $\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {total }}=0\\left[\\because \\Delta \\mathrm{~S}_{\\text {sys }}=-\\right.$ $\\left.\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {surr }}\\right]$\nSimilarly, for an equilibrium process $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}=0$\n\nFor spontaneous process, $\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {total }}>0$, so\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {total }}>0$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {system }}+\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {surroundings }}>0$\n$\\frac{\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\text {sys }}}{\\mathrm{T}}-\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {system }}>0$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\text {sys }}-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {sys }}>0$\n$\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {sys }}-\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\text {sys }}<0$\n$-\\left(\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\text {sys }}-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {sys }}\\right)>0$\n$-(\\Delta \\mathrm{G})>0$\nhence for a spontaneous process,\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{G}<0$\ni.e. $\\Delta \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}<0-----(7.37)$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\text {sys }}$ is the enthalpy change of a reaction, $\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\text {sys }}$ is the energy which is not available to do useful work. So $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}$ is the net energy available to do useful work and is thus a measure of the 'free energy'. For this reason, it is also known\nas the free energy of the reaction. For non spontaneous process, $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}>0$\n\nGibbs free energy and the net work done by the system:\n\nFor any system at constant pressure and temperature\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{G}=\\Delta \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}----(7.36)$\nWe know that,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\Delta \\mathrm{H}=\\Delta \\mathrm{U}+\\mathrm{P} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V} \\\\\n& \\therefore \\Delta \\mathrm{G}=\\Delta \\mathrm{U}+\\mathrm{P} \\Delta \\mathrm{~V}-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{~S}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nfrom first law of thermodynamics\n\n$$\n\\Delta \\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{q}+\\mathrm{w}\n$$\n\nfrom second law of thermodynamics\n$\\Delta S=\\frac{q}{T} \\Delta G=q+w+P \\Delta V-T\\left(\\frac{q}{T}\\right)$\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{G}=\\mathrm{w}+\\mathrm{P} \\Delta \\mathrm{V}$\n$-\\Delta \\mathrm{G}=-\\mathrm{w}-\\mathrm{P} \\Delta \\mathrm{V}$ $\\qquad$ .(7.38)\n\nBut $-\\mathrm{P} \\Delta \\mathrm{V}$ represents the work done due to expansion against a constant external pressure. Therefore, it is clear that the decrease in free energy $(-\\Delta \\mathrm{G})$ accompanying a process taking place at constant temperature and pressure is equal to the maximum work obtainable from the system other than the work of expansion.\n\n### 7.11.1 Criteria for spontaneity of a process\n\nThe spontaneity of any process depends on three different factors.\n\n- If the enthalpy change of a process is negative, then the process is exothermic and may be spontaneous. $(\\Delta \\mathrm{H}$ is negative)\n- If the entropy change of a process is positive, then the process may occur spontaneously. ( $\\Delta \\mathrm{S}$ is positive)\n- The gibbs free energy which is the\n\ncombination of the above two $(\\Delta \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S})$ should be negative for a reaction to occur spontaneously, i.e. the necessary condition for a reaction to be spontaneous is $\\Delta \\mathrm{H}$ $-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}<0$\n\nTable 7.5 Effect of Temperature on Spontaneity of Reactions:\n\n| $\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{r}}$ | $\\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{r}}$ | $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}_{\\mathrm{r}}=\\Delta \\mathrm{H}_{\\mathrm{r}}-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}_{\\mathrm{r}}$ | Description | Example |\n| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |\n| - | + | $-(a t$ all T$)$ | Spontaneous at all temperature | $2 \\mathrm{O}_{3}(\\mathrm{~g}) \\rightarrow 3 \\mathrm{O}_{2}(\\mathrm{~g})$ |\n| - | - | $-(a t$ low T$)$ | spontaneous at low temperature | Adsorption of gases |\n|  |  | $+(a t$ high T$)$ | non-spontaneous at high temperature |  |\n| + | + | $+(a t$ low T$)$ | non-spontaneous at low temperature | Melting of a solid |\n|  |  | $-(a t$ high T$)$ | spontaneous at high temperature |  |\n| + | - | $+(a t$ all T$)$ | non spontancos at all temperatn es | $\\begin{aligned} & 2 \\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{~g}+\\mathrm{O}_{2}(\\mathrm{~g} \\rightarrow \\\\ & 2 \\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}_{2}(\\mathrm{l}) \\end{aligned}$ |\n\nThe Table assumes $\\Delta \\mathrm{H}$ and $\\Delta \\mathrm{S}$ will remain the way indicated for all temperatures. It may not be necessary that way. The Spontaneity of a chemical reaction is only the potential for the reaction to proceed as written.

A reversible chemical reaction can proceed in either direction simultaneously, so that a dynamic equilibrium is set up. This means that the reactions in both the directions should proceed with decrease in free energy, which is impossible. It is possible only if at equilibrium, the free energy of a system is minimum.

Lower the temperature, lower is the entropy. For example, water above $100^{9} \\mathrm{C}$ at one atmosphere exists as a gas and has higher entropy (higher disorder). The water molecules are free to roam about in the entire container. When the system is cooled, the water vapour condenses to form a liquid. The water molecules in liquid phase still can move about somewhat freely. Thus the entropy of the system has decreased. On further cooling, water freezes to form ice crystal. The water molecules in the ice crystal are highly ordered and entropy of the system is very low.\n\nIf we cool the solid crystal still further, the vibration of molecules held in the crystal lattice gets slower and they have very little freedom of movement (very little disorder) and hence very small entropy.\n\nAt absolute zero ( 0 K or -273 K ), theoretically all modes of motion stop.\n\nAbsolute zero is a temperature that an object can get arbitrarily close to but absolute zero will remain unattainable.\n\nThus the third law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of pure crystalline substance at absolute zero is zero. Otherwise it can be stated as it is impossible to lower the temperature of an object to absolute zero in a finite number of steps. Mathematically,\n$\\lim _{T \\rightarrow 0} S=0$ for a perfectly ordered crystalline state.\n![img-19.jpeg](img-19.jpeg)\n\nFigure 7.10 Third law of Thermodynamics\n\nCrystals with defects (imperfection) at absolute zero, have entropy greater than zero. Absolute entropy of a substance can never be negative.\n\n# SUMMARY \n\nThe branch of science which deals the relation between energy, heat and work is called Thermodynamics. The main aim of the study of chemical thermodynamics is to learn (i) transformation of energy from one form into another form (ii) Utilization of various forms of energies.\n\nSystem: A system is defined as any part of universe under consideration. There are three types of thermodynamic systems. They are (i) isolated system (ii) closed system and (iii) open system.\n\nSurrounding: Everything in the universe that is not the part of the system is called surrounding.\n\nBoundary: Anything which separates the system from its surrounding is called boundary.\n\nThermodynamic Properties: Any quantity that depends only on the state of system is called thermodynamic property of a system. There are two kinds of thermodynamic properties called (1) intensive - independent of the quantity of material and (2) extensive - directly proportional to the quantity of material. There are five basic thermodynamic properties. (U,H,S and G)\n\n## Thermodynamic Processes:\n\nAdiabatic process in which no heat transfer takes place $(\\mathrm{q}=0)$\n\nIsothermal process in which\ntemperature remains constant $(\\mathrm{dT}=0)$.\nIsobaric process in which pressure remains constant $(\\mathrm{dP}=0)$.\n\nIsochoric process in which volume remains constant $(\\mathrm{dV}=0)$.\n\nCyclic process in which the system returns to its original state after completing a series of changes.\n\nInternal energy (U): Internal energy of a system is equal to the energy possessed by all its constituents namely atoms, ions and molecules. The energy of a system of molecules is equal to the sum of its translational energy, vibrational energy, rotational energy, bond energy, electronic energy and energy due to molecular interactions.\n\nHeat: Heat is regarded as the energy in transit across the boundary separating a system from its surrounding. Heat is a path function. The SI unit of heat is joule (J)\n\nWork : Work is defined as the force (F) multiplied by the displacement $-\\mathrm{w}=\\mathrm{F} . \\mathrm{x}$, work is measured in Joules, i.e the SI unit of work is Joule. During expansion or compression of a gas the work done is calculated by the relation $\\mathrm{w}=-\\mathrm{P} \\Delta \\mathrm{V}$.\n\nThe sign conventions for heat and work are as follows:\n\nIf heat is absorbed by the system : +q\n\nIf heat is evolved by the system : -q\nIf work is done by the system : -w\nIf work is done on the system : +w\nLaws of Thermodynamics:\nZeroth law : When two systems are separately in equilibrium with a third system, they are in equilibrium with each other.\n\nFirst law: \"Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but may be converted from one form to another\".\n$\\Delta \\mathrm{U}=\\mathrm{q}+\\mathrm{w}$.\nEnthalpy is a thermodynamic property of a system. Enthalpy H is defined as the sum of the internal energy and pressure volume work.\n$\\mathrm{H}=\\mathrm{U}+\\mathrm{PV}$. Enthalpy change, $\\Delta \\mathrm{H}=\\Delta \\mathrm{U}+$ $\\Delta \\mathrm{n}_{\\mathrm{g}} \\mathrm{RT}$.\n\nHess's law: It states that \"the enthalpy change of a reaction either at constant volume or constant pressure is the same whether it takes place in a single or multiple steps\". Hess's law can be applied to calculate enthalpies of reactions that are difficult to measure.\n\nHeat capacities: $\\left[\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{p}}\\right.$ and $\\left.\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{v}}\\right]$\nHeat capacity is defined as the amount of energy required to increase the temperature of one unit quantity of material by one degree, under specific conditions. It can be measured under two different conditions, namely,\n(a) constant pressure $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{p}}=\\mathrm{dH} / \\mathrm{dT}$\n(b) constant volume $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{v}}=\\mathrm{dU} / \\mathrm{dT}$\n\nSecond law of thermodynamics:\nThe second law of thermodynamics helps us to predict whether the reaction is feasible or not and also tells the direction of the flow of heat.\n\nTo predict spontaneity of a process, a new thermodynamic quantity namely entropy (S) was introduced. Entropy is a measure of the randomness or disorderliness of the system.\n\nEntropy statement: \"whenever a spontaneous process takes place, it is accompanied by an increase in the total entropy of the universe\".\n\nKelvin-Planck statement: It is impossible to take heat from a hotter reservoir and convert it completely into work by a cyclic process without transferring a part of that heat to a colder reservoir.\n\nClausius statement: This statement recognises that heat flows spontaneously from hot objects to cold objects and to get it flow in the opposite direction, we have to spend some work.\n\nGibbs Free Energy (G):\nG is expressed as $\\mathrm{G}=\\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{TS}$, free energy change of a process is given by the relation $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}=\\Delta \\mathrm{H}-\\mathrm{T} \\Delta \\mathrm{S}$.\n\nStandard free energy change and equilibrium constants are related by the equation $\\Delta \\mathrm{G}^{0}=-\\mathrm{RTln} \\mathrm{K}_{\\mathrm{eq}}$\n\n## Third law:\n\nThe entropy of a perfectly crystalline material at absolute zero is zero.\n\n# EVALUATION \n\n## I.
